## Overview

### Technologies used:

* **Backend**: Node.js, SQL, Express.js
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars.js
* **Other**: MySQL, Heroku, JawsDB

### Project Insight

* Using a mixture Handlebars.js and API calls, dynamically move existing burgers and create new burgers at your will. 
* On the left, you'll see all the burgers that are _on the menu_; on the right you'll see the burgers that're _on your table_; and finally at the bottom, you'll have the option of _adding a burger_ to the menu.
* Got a _fresh_ idea? Add your burger to the menu! Don't like what you _ordered_? Send it back to the kitchen! Enjoy it? Well, bring it to your table!

## Steps

### _What's On The Menu_ panel

1) Clicking the "Order!" button sends that burger to the "on your table" panel

### _Your Table_ panel

1) Clicking on the "Send it back!" button sends that burger straight back to Bob. That'll teach him!

### _Custom Order_ panel

1) In the text field provided, enter the name of the burger you'd like Bob and the crew to make

2) When you're satisfied with the name, press the "Submit" button to send your custom burger to Bob, so he can make it specially for you!

## That's it!
